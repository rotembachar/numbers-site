    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 9, 2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>Numbers</strong> (“we,” “our,” or “us”). By accessing or using our website (the “Site”), you agree to these Terms of Use (“Terms”). Please read them carefully before using or purchasing from the project.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Definitions</h2>
    <p>“User” means any person who visits or interacts with the Site. “Purchase” refers to the act of buying a symbolic number through our system. “Certificate” means the digital document provided as proof of symbolic ownership. “We,” “our,” and “us” refer to the creators and operators of the Numbers project.</p>

    <h2>Purpose of the Project</h2>
    <p><strong>Numbers</strong> is a conceptual, artistic, and digital project. Each purchase represents the symbolic act of owning a unique number within a continuous global sequence. Purchasing a number does not constitute investment, speculation, or acquisition of any tangible or financial asset. All certificates are symbolic and artistic representations only.</p>

    <h2>Eligibility</h2>
    <p>By using this Site, you confirm that you are at least 18 years of age or of legal age in your jurisdiction, and that you have full capacity to enter into binding agreements. If you are accessing on behalf of another entity, you represent that you are authorized to do so.</p>

    <h2>Symbolic Ownership</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Purchasing a number grants you symbolic recognition only. No copyright, trademark, intellectual property, or resale rights are transferred.</li>
      <li>Certificates are digital images or representations created automatically by our system and have no monetary or legal value.</li>
      <li>We reserve the right to issue additional numbers indefinitely as part of the project’s ongoing narrative.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Payments and Refund Policy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Payments are processed securely through third-party providers such as PayPal or Stripe.</li>
      <li>Transactions are final and non-refundable unless otherwise required by applicable law.</li>
      <li>We do not store any credit card or payment details on our servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Site may use services operated by third parties (e.g., Supabase, PayPal, Stripe). We are not responsible for the performance, accuracy, or security of third-party systems, and their use is governed by their own terms of service and privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>Data Privacy and Security</h2>
    <p>We collect minimal information necessary to process purchases and maintain authenticity verification. Data may include email address, transaction ID, and number purchased. We use Supabase for secure data storage and industry-standard encryption practices. However, no online platform is entirely risk-free, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of transmitted data.</p>

    <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the Site for unlawful, fraudulent, or harmful purposes.</li>
      <li>Interfere with or disrupt the performance or security of the Site.</li>
      <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer, copy, or modify the Site’s source code or database.</li>
      <li>Create fake or misleading certificates or misrepresent ownership.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Termination of Access</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate access to the Site at our sole discretion if we believe you have violated these Terms or applicable law.</p>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All site content, visuals, code, text, and layout are the property of <strong>Numbers</strong> unless otherwise noted. You may not copy, modify, or redistribute any materials without written consent.</p>

    <h2>Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless <strong>Numbers</strong>, its creators, and affiliates from any claims, damages, or expenses arising out of your violation of these Terms or misuse of the Site.</p>

    <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The Site and its contents are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We make no warranties or representations of any kind, express or implied, regarding the Site’s reliability, functionality, or suitability for any purpose. We disclaim all implied warranties including merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, <strong>Numbers</strong> and its creators shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of or in connection with your use of the Site or participation in the project.</p>

    <h2>Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Israel, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts in Tel Aviv, Israel. Alternatively, we may agree to resolve disputes through arbitration in Israel under a mutually accepted arbitrator.</p>

    <h2>Changes to the Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update or modify these Terms at any time. The updated version will be posted on this page with a new effective date. Continued use of the Site after such updates constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
