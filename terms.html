  <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 9, 2025</p>

  <p>Welcome to <strong>Numbers</strong> (“we,” “our,” or “us”). By accessing or using our website (the “Site”), you agree to these Terms of Use (“Terms”). Please read them carefully before purchasing or using any part of this project.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>1. Purpose of the Project</h2>
  <p><strong>Numbers</strong> is a conceptual and artistic digital project. Each purchase represents the symbolic act of “owning” a unique number in an ongoing global sequence. When you buy a number, you receive a <strong>digital certificate of symbolic ownership</strong> — not a financial, legal, or blockchain-based asset. Participation in this project is intended for artistic and emotional expression, not for profit or investment.</p>

  <h2>2. Symbolic Ownership</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Purchasing a number grants you <strong>symbolic recognition</strong> only. You do not acquire any copyright, trademark, intellectual property, or resale rights.</li>
    <li>Certificates provided by <strong>Numbers</strong> are digital representations generated by our system and hold no monetary or legal value.</li>
    <li>The project reserves the right to continue issuing additional numbers indefinitely as part of the sequence.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Payments</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All payments are processed securely through third-party services such as PayPal or Stripe.</li>
    <li>All transactions are <strong>final and non-refundable</strong>, unless otherwise required by law.</li>
    <li>We do not store credit card or payment details on our servers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Certificate Authenticity</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Each certificate is recorded in our database at the time of purchase.</li>
    <li>You can verify ownership through the <a href="/verify.html">verify page</a>.</li>
    <li>Any altered or reproduced certificate without verification is invalid.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>You agree not to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the Site for illegal, fraudulent, or malicious activity.</li>
    <li>Interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Site.</li>
    <li>Attempt to copy, modify, or reverse-engineer the Site or database.</li>
    <li>Create misleading or fake certificates.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p><strong>Numbers</strong> and its creators are not responsible for any direct or indirect damages arising from the use or inability to use the Site. All functionality is provided “as is,” without warranties of any kind.</p>

  <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>All website design, layout, and written content are the property of <strong>Numbers</strong> unless otherwise stated. You may not reproduce, distribute, or modify any part of the Site without written permission.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to the Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms occasionally. Continued use of the Site after an update constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

  <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of [Your Country/State]. Any disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that location.</p>

  <h2>10. Contact</h2>
